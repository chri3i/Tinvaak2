# The game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Tinvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

## Gameplay

Tinvaak uses Master of One as it's perk overhaul. The basis of the mod is to provide a mixture of positives and negatives to taking perks. With power, comes consequences.

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than only getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing monsters.

2. [Class Overhaul Re Imagined(CORI)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24808) and [Early Life Skill Adjustment(ELSA)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23126) form the core of the roleplaying overhaul mods. Your character will now develop and can specialise in areas right from the start.

3. [Aetherius - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) is a streamlined race overhaul designed to make races more meaningful without making them more restrictive. Greater powers have been removed in favor of modest but desirable passives. Although each race has been designed to fill a specific role, the nature of these bonuses allow for a broad range of builds to benefit from them. 

4. [Growl - Werebeasts of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) for overhauling Lycanthrophy and adding the option to play as a werebear.

5. [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408) is a high depth, low complexity vampire mod. It is a cleaned up and slimmed down version of Sacrosanct, offering an in-depth vampire experience without feature bloat. 

6. [Skyrim Alchemy and Food Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12343) A comprehensive change to food inspired by Requiem Overhaul and BRG The Gourmet from Legendary Edition 
 	- We're only using the food portion of this mod, SkyRe handles alchemy.

7. [iHarvest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27789) This mod adds a single spell, "Harvest". To use the spell, just cast it. Note that, as a concentration spell, it will continue to operate as long as you cast it. It will scan your surroundings, learn what in the area can be harvested, and finally send out little, magical Getter Critters to fetch stuff for you. To get the spell, you'll have to find a spellbook.

8. [Khajiit Speak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37197) is used in the Tinvaak Khajiit Speak Profile, along with many patches, as well as custom patches specific to Tinvaak.

9. [Lethal Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3860) traps dispersed around the world of Skyrim will now deal much more damage, alert nearby enemies and can also stagger you! In addition to all of this, traps are unleveled, carefully balanced and are much more effective against enemies. 

10. [Zim's Dragon Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38693) The aim of this mod is to provide a subtle, lore-friendly improvement to the Dragons of Skyrim that makes encountering one feel more like a boss fight and less like a slightly-more-difficult animal encounter. 

## Magic and Religion Mods

Tinvaak comes with a few of the popular magic and religion mods which have been fully patched to fit in with both SkyRe and the world that Tinvaak creates.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) which adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090) is the most popular Skyrim spell pack, adding 155 new spells that are unique, balanced, lore friendly, use high quality custom visuals and blend seamlessly into the vanilla magic system. Also includes scrolls and staves for the new spells.

3. [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) complements Apocalypse by adding a lot of new staves and scrolls to the game which are lore friendly and slot into the world nicely.

4. [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) overhauls vanilla spells and also adds in some lore friendly ones which slot into the world rather nicely.

5. [Trua - Minimalistic Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32549) adds a lite roleplaying flavor religion aspect to the game.

6. [Renounce the Daedra: Epic Restoration Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36100)  this mod adds a Restoration spell called Renounce. If you cast it during a Daedric quest, it'll fail it automatically. Beware, cultists nearby may turn against you. 
    - You can find a tome in the following locations:
        - Whiterun, the Temple of Kynareth, on the bench next to the altar
        - Hall of the Vigilants, on one of the benches.
        - Markarth, Temple of Dibella, near an altar
        - Riften, Temple of Mara, on the main desk
        - Solitude, Temple of the Divines, near Stendarr's shrine

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Tinvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396) Turn your adventures into a game filled with consequences. For the good natured adventurer, this mod allows you to see the changes you made actually take effect. The world will be repopulated as you free Skyrim of its fouls inhabitants.

2. [The Brotherhood of Old](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15322) is a quest mod for Skyrim, taking place after the final quest in the original Dark Brotherhood questline. This 24 quest epic will take you all across the land of Skyrim, as you try and rebuild the Brotherhood and strengthen it against future attacks. 

3. [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time... 

4. [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996) is a large quest modification, comparable in size to a medium-sized DLC. Designed in the best traditions of Bethesda Game Studios, this mod adds to Skyrim a hidden settlement of Great Homee Telvanni. Determine its fate for yourself! 
	- We also have the Unofficial Patches for Project AHO.

5. [Extended Encounters SSE](https://archive.org/details/extendedencounters1.5sse) is a simple mod that adds to the pool of random roadside, wilderness and location encounters in a way that makes the world seem a bit more dynamic and alive without negatively affecting game performance or bloating your save file. For example, you'll see mercenaries out in the world doing their job, faction raids on specific locations, adventurers traveling into dungeons, guards clearing bandit camps, and so on. You will also see new visitors at settlements, towns and cities from time to time. NPCs may also deviate from their regular routine to visit different locations. Sleeping and waiting in or fast traveling to a dangerome location such as a bandit camp or vampire lair may also lead to an encounter with denizens that call those places home. An MCM is included that allows you to toggle all features added by this mod.

6. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards.

## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

Tinvaak uses a carefully selected range of city, town and village mods that balance new additions with performance. In the case where a mod was deemed to be a little too performance heavy, optimisation passes have been made to remove unnescessary clutter.

1. [JK's SuperLite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71018) and [Dawn of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9074) are the mods that overhaul the main cities. These have been merged together to provide a performance friendly new take on the hold capitals.

2. [Cities of the North Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), [Cities of the North Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168), [The Great City of Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19709) and [Capital of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34222) are used to breathe new life into the minor holds and create an experience that feels both fresh and memorable.

3. [Thanedom of Series](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42928635?tab=user+files) is a series of mods created by Axis1211 that make small and tasteful changes to the minor settlements. These individual mods have been merged together to create a master small location overhaul.

## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137) is an old bounty hunting adventurer and a brutal companion to travel with. One of the most visually customized followers made for Skyrim, Hoth has many one-of-a-kind features including being a quest giver for infinite bounty hunt contracts. 

3. [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in archery, one-handed, and sneak. 

## Music and Weather

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Tinvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Northener Diaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108) adds a selection of tasteful new soundtracks to the in game music. 

2. [Vivid Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187) is the weather mod of choice for Tinvaak. It was chosen over other weather mods for just how damn gorgeous it makes the game look.

3. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

4. [True Storms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2472) enhances the stormy nature of Skyrim and makes the rain and thunderstorms truly feel like a force of nature.

5. [Supreme and Volumetric Fog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23431) again pretty much does what it says. Expect the early morning mists to feel truly misty instead of like the steam from a kettle.

## Survival

Tinvaak comes with the option of having Survival mods should you wish to play with them. Please note they can be disabled **ON A NEW GAME ONLY.**

1. [Campsite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22353) is a simple camping mod that allows the player to build a campfire and pitch a tent. Campsite is built in the vanilla style using only existing items. It is designed to feel like an unintrusive, optional extra feature of the game that isn't noticed when not used. While camping mods with extra features already exist, the author wanted to create something simple without a perk tree, new items, spells or powers added to the magic menu.

2. [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is a survival and needs mod. Many other survival options are either too large in scope, or too lightweight and do not have full survival features. The author wanted SunHelm to bridge the gap where a full feature mod was needed, but in a somewhat lightweight and performance friendly manner.
