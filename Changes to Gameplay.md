# The video game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Tinvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

- *Note: This list is not exhaustive. Many other components to the list are not listed here deliberatly so that you can find them out.*

## Gameplay

Tinvaak uses [Ordii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55200) as its perk overhaul. This is a slightly tweaked version of Ordinator which allows for skill caps of over 100 and uses Vokrii's skill scaling.

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than only getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing enemies.

2. [Class Overhaul Re Imagined(CORI)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51043) and [Attribute Value Application(AVA)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23329) form the core of the roleplaying overhaul mods. Your character will now develop and can specialise in areas right from the start.

3. [Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890) fundamentally changes how races are done with an emphasis of putting both NPCs and the player on a even playing field. Expect a different experience from what you are used with certain races being more skilled than others in certain areas.

4. [Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Werewolf system designed to balance existing Werewolf mechanics and add powerful new lycanthropic abilities to the game. This is used alongside [Simple Werewolf Favourite Howls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35736) to provide a consistent experience across both vampire lords and werebeasts.

5. [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408) is a high depth, low complexity vampire mod. It is a cleaned up and slimmed down version of Sacrosanct, offering an in-depth vampire experience without feature bloat.

6. [Heim - Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) provides an overhaul to smithing with minimal edits to ensure compatibility. You will need to find forging manuals in order to unlock each respective category in the forge menu.

7. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) changes loot and encounter zones to provide an open world and immersive experience, letting the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration. 

8. [Khajiit Speak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37197) is used in the Tinvaak Khajiit Speak Profile, along with many patches, as well as custom patches specific to Tinvaak.

9. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) changes dragons so that they feel like a true boss fight, with a range of new attacks and abilities. Expect dragons to offer a true battle to remember.

10. [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s alchemy, food, and alcohol systems designed to balance existing options while adding powerful new effects to the game. This is coupled with [BA Alchemist Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) and other mods to open up many new playstyles with alchemical items.

## Magic Mods

Tinvaak comes with a a curated selection of Magic mods to fit a range of different mage archetypes.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [The Dark Arts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834) seeks to improve the Necromancy experience in Skyrim. It allows you to customize reanimated thralls, introduces rituals to create and upgrade a wide range of undead creatures, allows players to dissect corpses and harvest ingredients, reintroduces the Shade of the Revenant, and adds a few Necromancy related spells.

3. [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) improves and fixes vanilla Skyrim spells, makes scrolls and staves viable, and adds new spells, scrolls, and staves inspired by previous Elder Scrolls magic.

4. [Summermyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285) overhauls and adds new enchantments to the world. This has been custom tweaked to ensure optimum variety and diversity.

5. [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) gives the player the opportunity to become, through the course of their long and arduous journey of exploration and study, a terrifying and destructive undead Lich. [Classic Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802) and [Prelude to Purgatory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53143) are also used to both fix and enhance this mechanic to offer a true, 'third' supernatural archetype for characters to play.

6. [Dino's Spell Discovery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43929?tab=description) changes magic so it is no longer instantly learned through spell tomes. In fact, all spell tomes have been removed from leveled lists and vendors. You will embark on a journey of knowledge to discover and unlock your innate arcane talents through methods such as spellcrafting and spell theory, to even reverse-engineering spells or creating a grimoire to store your spells for a later use should you wish to unlearn them. A mage is no longer some tome consuming void, and you will now have to take care to prepare notes and research the spells you wish to create. We implore you all to check out the mod page for a full breakdown of its features, though! We wish you good luck on your journey through Aetherius!

## Combat Mods

Tinvaak 2 completely reworks combat from the previous version by including a fully updated suite of mechanics and animations.

1. [Engarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25673) forms the bread and butter of the combat mechanics. It features numerous changes to the way combat is done in Skyrim and is covered in its own guide.

2. [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) overhauls the third-person gameplay similarly to modern action RPGs, entirely through SKSE. Move and attack in any direction.

3. [SkySa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31390) forms the basis of the new combat animation framework. The Elder Souls style animations are then used to provide realistic and fitting animations for weapons in the game. 

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Tinvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396) and [Lawbringer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882) allows you to make an impact on Skyrim by clearing locations for factions or guards. Once claimed or cleared, the locations will change accordingly.

2. [HeadHunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847) expands bounty quests for Bandits, Forsworn, Giants and Dragons. Like in the Witcher 3, you can bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.

3. [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time... 

4. [OBIS SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145), [High Level Enemies Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32801), [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) and Druidic Bandits form the core of the expanded enemy system. Encounters will no longer be simple affiars, with a larger variety of bandits and more of them. Expect the unexpected.

5. [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) adds brand new creatures which fit in to the world of Skyrim, alongside variations of existing creatures, adding diversity and improving gameplay.

6. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards. 

## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

Tinvaak uses a range of different settlement mods to try and give each location its own unique flair. In areas where compatability or performance was sub-optimal, this has been patched and tweaked.

[RedBag's Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42052), [Alternative Riften](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101461), [Capital Whiterun Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982), [Capital Windhelm Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990) and [SKY CITY - Markarth Rising](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22482) provide the major holds with both a facelift and also a unique feel. Expect changes such as new districts, soaring dwemer structures, new NPC's and more. [JK's Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814?tab=user+files) are also used to provide unique feeling to key locations that you will visit.

[Cities of the North Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), [ClefJ's Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41409), [ClefJ's Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49546) and [The Great City of Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19709) are used to breathe new life into minor hold capitals. Expect to find some unique architecture, new NPC's, new building layouts, and other changes.

[The Great City/Town/Village](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10182460?tab=user+files) series by SoldierofWar are used to provide smaller settlements with the uplift they needed. With unique arthitecture styles and meaningful changes, these mods provide the base for the smaller location overhauls. The [Thanedom of Series](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42928635?tab=user+files) by Axis1211 are then used to fill in the gaps. The mods make small and tasteful edits to small locations and add some new ones for you to discover as you explore the world.

## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place, and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking, he won't chatter, and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in Archery, One-Handed, and Sneak. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Shirley](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45956), the beloved Skyrim Grandma, finally comes to the game as a follower you can recruit! She'll join you on your adventures, but don't expect her to simply carry your burdens!

5. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!

## Music and Weather

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Tinvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Obsidian Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125) is the weather mod of choice for Tinvaak 2. Pairing with the ENB perfectly, it provides the perfect backdrop for the list.

2. [Yet Another Music Merge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48725) pretty much does what it says and serves as a master plugin for a range of musical additions. Check the mod page for more details on the music that's patched.

3. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

4. [Immersive Sounds Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523) provides a dramatic and marked update to many of the sounds in the game. This is merged with AOS to create the perfect overhaul to the sounds in game.

## Survival & Immersion

Tinvaak comes with multiple survival and immersion mods which form part of the core basis of the list.

1. [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) is the most feature-rich stand-alone camping mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It was created from Frostfall 2.6's unique, immersive camping system. Now, you can enjoy an unparalleled camping experience in conjunction with some of your other favorite survival and immersion mods.

2. [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is a survival and needs mod. Many other survival options are either too large in scope, or they are too lightweight and do not have full survival features. The author wanted SunHelm to bridge the gap where a full feature mod was needed, but in a somewhat lightweight and performance friendly manner.

3. [Dirt and Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886) makes it so that your character will accumulate dirt and blood dynamically, which you can clean by swimming, standing in the rain, or taking a bath. The effects are mostly visual only and do not affect gameplay. NPCs will also get bloody as a result of battles.

4. [Potion Toxicity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32576) makes it so that if you abuse potions your character will become addicted. Think twice before you start chugging potions of health; they may do you more harm than good.

5. [L.V.X Magicks - Campfire Unleashed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11001), [Dylbill's Positioner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33917) and [Decorator Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11708) provide the framework for settlement creation. Setup your own headquarters anywhere or add the extension you always wanted to your Hearthfire house.

(**IMPORTANT:** If you plan on spawning large structures such as houses, forts, towers, etc. - once you have spawned them in, be sure to save, exit and then restart the game. Failure to do so could result in a corrupted save file due to how Skyrim reads static objects. Interior cell renovations do not seem to cause this at all, so carry on as per usual there.)
